    <h1>Site Plan</h1>
    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p>This site is going to be named <b>Better Weather</b>. The word "better" refers to more accurate weather forecasting, easier look up of the weather, and easy to read results after a look up of the weather forecast. To go along with the site name, the domain name will be <b>mybetterweather.com</b> which is an available domain name.

    <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
    <p>As briefly mentioned in the site name, the purpose of this website is to make looking up the weather a better and easier experience for all who use it. The goal is to make results fast and easy to understand while still giving the most accurate results to the forecast. 

    These goals will be accomplished by using easy to read images for each hour of the day, and not overcrowding the website so it is simple and runs quickly. To ensure accurate weather reading, the forecast will be updated often and will show a time stamp of when it was last updated. By making these extra efforts, the hope is to provide a service people will want to use above all others.

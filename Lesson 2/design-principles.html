            Visual Hierarchy is a design principle where certain objects are more prominent than others to show importance. In this website from Target, visual hierarchy is used with the use of a large picture, paired with a large deal to catch the shopper's eye. There is even a boarder on one picture in deep red to catch the eye showing that the deal ends today. When one looks closer, they can see the restrictions of the deal that may be less desirable. Nevertheless, their attention was first drawn by the image and bold title.

        <img src="/images/proximity.jpg">
        <p>
            Proximity is using spacing, or lack of spacing, to group items together or separate them from one another. This website uses the design principle of proximity because a viewer can see each individual item of content based on the gap of white between each square. Viewers can distinctly tell between each of the items.

        <h4><a href="https://www.jcpenney.com/g/women/womens-dresses?id=cat100210008&cm_re=ZB-_-LF-_-WOMENS_Womens_Dresses%7C1%7C">JcPenney</a></h4>

            Hick's Law states that the more options you have, the more time it is going to take to make a decision. This is true with menus, shopping, and even choosing what to wear in the morning. A solution to this problem is to create filters to narrow down your search to what you are looking for. JcPenney has an excellent filter system. With the store's wide selection of inventory, it is important that shoppers find exactly what they are looking for in the shortest amount of time possible. The specifics of this filter system really do accomplish that goal.
